Check out the live demo at: [Git-Trend](https://gittrend.onrender.com)

## Key Features

- Display trending repositories and developers of the day
- View detailed information about repositories and developers
- Add repositories and developers to favorites
- User authentication and user profiles

This web app is built using Python and the Flask framework for the backend. It utilizes PostgreSQL as the database management system and SQLAlchemy as the Python SQL toolkit and ORM library. The frontend development is done using Bootstrap for CSS styling and jQuery for interactivity.

To ensure secure password storage, the web app utilizes bcrypt, a powerful hashing function. bcrypt provides a secure way to hash and verify passwords, protecting user credentials in the database.

The data for trending repositories and developers is obtained from GitHub using BeautifulSoup.

The project is deployed on Render.com. The backend and frontend components are seamlessly integrated using Jinja templating for rendering dynamic content in HTML templates.

## Future Vision

The long-term vision for Git-Trend is to expand its functionality and become a place for developers to explore trending repositories and developers in a new way.
